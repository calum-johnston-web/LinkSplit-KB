To the right of your Dashboard there is a blue button that reads “Create New”. Click here and then opt for the "Short URL’ option in the drop down menu. 

### 1) Enter your destination URL

Type in your destination URL. This is the URL that will be shortened. If you have more than one, simply click on the blue text that reads “Toggle Batch Mode”, and type in the multiple URLs you would like to shorten. This will create a unique shortened URL for each entry.

*(this will not create a single link with multiple destinations, to create a single link that redirects to multiple destination see “How to Create a Link Rotator”)*

### 2) Create your own link URL (Optional)

To name your own URL, type in the name of your choice into the box under the “Link URL” subheading. If you opt not to type in your own URL, LinkSplit will randomly generate one for you.

### 3) Select your domain

Under subheading "Link URL’, opt for either the "tny.sh’ or "split.to’ by clicking the drop down menu and making a selection. If you have added a Custom Domain you may also select it here.

### 4) Choose your Settings (Optional)

LinkSplit provides additional options such as Link Expiry (time or clicks), and adding Tracking Pixels. Select any of the settings you would like to enable on your link rotator.

### 5) Create!

By clicking the blue "Shorten URL’ button your link rotator will be instantly created and ready for sharing.
