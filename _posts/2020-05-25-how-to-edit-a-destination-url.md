To the right of your Links, located on your dashboard, there is a category titled “actions”. Here, click on the settings icon (a small grey gear) to open the drop down menu. Select “edit” to begin destination editing for both link rotators and shortened URLs.

### 1) Open the edit menu

Click on the settings icon that correlates to the URL you would like to edit. The button is  located on the far right of your dashboard under “actions”. Select edit from the drop down menu

### 2) Edit your Destination

Click on the field containing the destination you would like to edit. Erase the previous destination typed into the field and type in the new destination you would like to update to.

### 3) Edit your percentages (optional: rotator only)

To send your traffic equally to each destination, leave the percentages as is. If you would like a custom split, for example, sending 10% of your traffic to one destination and 90% to another, then simply enter these percentages into the "Percent (%)" column. If you do not change the percentage, the same percentage of traffic will be sent to your new destination as was previously being sent to the edited destination.

The percentages weight determines the percentage of users sent to each destination, so they do not need to add up exactly to 100. Three destinations, all with an even split, will result in an even distribution. Three links with a split of 50/25/25 will result in half the visits being directed to the first destination, and one quarter each to the remaining two destinations.

### 4) Delete a destination (optional: rotator only)

Click on the red delete button located directly under a destination’s field to delete said destination from your URL-rotator link. The percentages will automatically update to an even split.

### 5) Add a destination (optional: doing so will change your shortened URL to a link-rotator)

Click on the grey “Add a Destination” button located at the bottom of your current destinations to add a new destination to your rotator. The percentages will automatically update to an even split.


### 5) Update link!

By clicking the blue "save link’ button at the bottom left of the edit screen, your link will be instantly updated and ready for sharing with your new destination edits.
