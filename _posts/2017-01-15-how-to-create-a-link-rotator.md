## How to Create a Link Rotator

To the right of your Dashboard there is a blue button that reads “Create New”. Click here and then opt for the ‘Link Rotator’ option in the drop down menu. 

You’re ready to create! Type in your destinations; if you have more than two, simply click on the grey ‘Add a Destination’ button. Under subheading ‘Link URL’, opt for either the ‘tny.sh’ or ‘split.to’ by clicking the drop down menu and making a selection. If you have added a Custom Domain you may also select it here. By clicking the blue ‘Create Link Rotator’ button your link rotator will be instantly created and ready for sharing.

LinkSplit link rotators are incredibly customizable. With a few extra clicks you can change your link's URL, domain, link expirations, and even add tracking pixels.
