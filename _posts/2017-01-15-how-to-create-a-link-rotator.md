To the right of your Dashboard there is a blue button that reads “Create New”. Click here and then opt for the "Link Rotator’ option in the drop down menu. 


### 1) Enter your destination URLs

Type in your destination URLs. These are the urls that your traffic will be sent to. If you have more than two, simply click on the grey "Add a Destination’ button.

### 2) Set your percentages (Optional)

To send your traffic equally to each destination, leave the percentages as is. If you would like a custom split, for example, sending 10% of your traffic to one destination and 90% to another, then simply enter these percentages into the "Percent (%)" column.

### 3) Select your domain

Under subheading "Link URL’, opt for either the "tny.sh’ or "split.to’ by clicking the drop down menu and making a selection. If you have added a Custom Domain you may also select it here.

### 4) Choose your Settings (Optional)

LinkSplit provides additional options such as Link Expiry (time or clicks), and adding Tracking Pixels. Select any of the settings you would like to enable on your link rotator.

### 5) Create!

By clicking the blue "Create Link Rotator’ button your link rotator will be instantly created and ready for sharing.
