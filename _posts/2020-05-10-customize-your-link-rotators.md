## Rotator Customization

LinkSplit link rotators are incredibly customizable. With a few extra clicks you can change your URLs name, link expirations, and even add retargeting tracking pixels.

### Link URLs

After opening the ‘Create a Link Rotator’ page, fill out your link destination (see article ____________ for a step by step process for basic link rotator creation).

Under the ‘Link URL’ subheading, type in your chosen URL name (ex. tny.sh/customization). The URL you choose will be the content following the link backslash. Here, you can also choose between LinkSplit domains. Or, if you have added a custom domain, select it here!

### Link Expiration

To limit link visits or set a timed expiration for your link, check the box under ‘Options’ reading ‘Expire link after’.

Select the ‘number of visit’ options to limit link clicks to a specific number of visits (i.e expire after 1000 link visits) , or select the ‘time elapsed’ option to expire your link after a certain amount of time (i.e expire 60 minutes after link creation).

### Pixels

If you have a tracking pixel for your destinations, add, manage, and select them here. 
To add a pixel to your rotator, click ‘add pixel’ and fill out the pixel’s name, select its ‘Pixel Platform’, and make sure to include your pixel’s ID. Once you have added pixels, you can select them by clicking on their box under the ‘Tracking Pixels’ subheading.
